  Definition here.

Dask Bag:
  Parallelizes computations across a large collection of generic Python objects. A bag is like a list but doesn’t guarantee an ordering among elements. There can be repeated elements, but you can’t ask for a particular element. Dask.bag can process unstructured or semi-structured data.

Opportunistic caching: 
  Definition here.

Tuple: 
  A sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, like lists. The difference between tuples and lists is that the tuples cannot be changed, and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.
